# insomnia-osquery-plugins

Here's a small collection of "example" plugins for osquery based on some of the plugins we've developed internally at Insomnia.

We're releasing these under an MIT license in the hopes that either they're useful as they are, or you may want to extend them to do something useful in your environment.

These are tested with version 3.0.5 of the official `osquery-python` API available from https://pypi.org/project/osquery/ though later versions are likely to work just fine.

Writing osquery plugins in Python is easy and fun! Give it a go :)
